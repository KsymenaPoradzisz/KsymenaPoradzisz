# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Good to see you! 

## Theoretical physicist in the making, but with a passion for computer science.

Now on my GitHub you can find the following repos:
- **AccretionCurrentsJulia** - a program which allows to visualise accretion currents around Schwarzschild black hole (In future: also around Kerr black hole) - made for my Master's thesis :)
- **TheWatcher** - a program for watching videos (W.I.P)
Repos which start with WFAIS contains codes, which were made to pass a course at my university.
